# UnityFirstTry
My first try to use unity. I've made a simple garden game

## Features
There are some interactable objects
### Grounds

Now, water barrel don't have any interactions: only water info in interaction menu

### Ground Interaction menu
There are you can buy this ground and interact with this after buying.

You can plant something and gather it after growth.

This is example of my coding style and my knowledge of Unity. There is no point to play, only collect money for buying new grounds and plant other plants.
